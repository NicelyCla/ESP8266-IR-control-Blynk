# ESP8266-IR-control-Blynk
I used an esp8266 to control the lights and the vacuum cleaner in a domotic way via an app (old version of Blynk).
Control takes place via infrared. Basically, a simple wireless remote control.
It is necessary to clone the infrared signal, I used the TSOP31238 sensor to acquire the signal.
The wiring diagram is quite intuitive.
Using this technique it is possible to control many objects.
