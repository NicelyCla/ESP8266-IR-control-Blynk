# ESP8266-IR-control-Blynk
I used an esp8266 to control the lights and the vacuum cleaner in a domotic way via an app (old version of Blynk).
Control takes place via infrared. Basically, a simple wireless remote control.__
It is necessary to clone the infrared signal, I used the TSOP31238 sensor to acquire the signal.__
The wiring diagram is quite intuitive.__
Using this technique it's possible to control in a domotic way many objects that are not natively domotic.__
Clearly a necessary and sufficient requirement is that the object could be controlled via an infrared remote control.
